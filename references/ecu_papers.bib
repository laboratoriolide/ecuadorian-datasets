  abstract = {The earnings of individuals depend on the demand for the factor services they supply. International trade may therefore affect earnings inequality because either (i) foreign consumers and firms demand domestic factor services in different proportions than domestic consumers and firms do, an export channel; or (ii) domestic consumers and firms change their demand for domestic factor services in response to the availability of foreign goods, an import channel. Building on this idea, we develop new measures of export and import exposure at the individual level and provide estimates of their incidence across the earnings distribution. The key input fed into our empirical analysis is a unique administrative data set from Ecuador that merges firm-to-firm transaction data, employer-employee matched data, owner-firm matched data, and firm-level customs transaction records. We find that export exposure is pro-middle class, import exposure is pro-rich, and in terms of overall incidence, the import channel is the dominant force. As a result, earnings inequality in Ecuador is higher than it would be in the absence of trade.},

We develop a multishock menu cost model in which retailers intermediate trade between producers and consumers. Since the cost share of intermediate inputs varies across goods, the model produces a cross-sectional distribution of frequency of price adjustment even though firms face a common menu cost. The model is evaluated using a rich micropanel of retail prices in Ecuador in a period spanning a financial crisis and subsequent dollarization.},

Our identification strategy exploits the fact that welfare was limited to individuals below a cutoff value on a household “poverty score”. We find no evidence that transfers discouraged work. However, among women, welfare payments led to reductions in social security contributions (which are mandated for salaried workers), although the magnitude of these effects is small.},

We provide a unique window into this global phenomenon using transaction-level tax data from Ecuador. Five percent of firms use ghost invoices annually. Among these firms, ghost transactions comprise 14 percent of purchases. Ghost transactions are prevalent among large firms and firms with high-income owners and exhibit suspicious patterns, such as bunching below financial system thresholds. An innovative enforcement intervention targeting ghost clients rather than ghosts themselves led to substantial tax recovery.},

  abstract = {Starting in 2017, Ecuador gradually expanded its primary healthcare access program nationwide using mobile traveling healthcare teams through the Estrategia Médico del Barrio (EMB) [or Neighborhood Doctor Strategy]. EMB teams, composed of a primary care physician, a nurse, and a community health worker, made home visits in marginalized areas. We estimate the impact of the EMB on health and utilization outcomes using nationally representative household surveys for 2006 (N~=~55,666), 2012–13 (N~=~92,500) and 2018–19 (N~=~168,747). The treatment variable at the extensive margin is any exposure to EMB at the canton level. At the intensive margin, we use exposure in terms of weeks covered by EMB and the number and composition of EMB personnel per 1000 population. We identify outcomes of treated vs. non- or partially-treated cantons based on the random combination of the timing of the start of the program’s implementation and the timing of the survey interview, which varied across cantons. We use difference-in-difference (DD) and difference-in-difference-in-difference (DDD) frameworks, the latter for cantons with high indigenous concentration. We find significant effects on the reported health problem and preventive care, but mixed results in terms of curative healthcare. The DDD specification shows that EMB improved health problem diagnoses and preventive healthcare utilization, including in highly indigenous cantons, yet it seemed to have mixed results in terms of curative care use in Ecuador. Various alternative specifications and robustness tests do not qualitatively alter the main findings.},

  abstract = {Several countries have implemented “family-centered” abstinence-only policies for teenagers, as opposed to encouraging utilization and expansion of reproductive health services and education. Little is known, however, about the effects of these more restrictive policies on adolescent birth rates at the national level or their differential effects by race and ethnicity. The extant literature is even scarcer in low- and middle-income countries. We analyze an unexpected policy change in Ecuador that abruptly reversed course and restricted reproductive health services for teenage women in 2014. We use a canton- and time-fixed effects difference-in-differences analysis of Ecuador’s 221 cantons with time-varying controls to analyze the impact of the abrupt policy change on the difference of teen (15−19 years) minus young adult (20−24\,years) birth rates. In a difference-in-difference-in-differences analysis, the policy change increases birth rates by 8.5 births per 1000 women in cantons with higher indigenous concentration. Results are robust to changes in the comparison population (young adults vs. women in their late 20\,s or in their early 30\,s), pre-intervention control periods, population weighting, serial correlation, logarithmic model specification, adjustments for intervention year, definition of indigenous concentration, and potential delays in policy implementation.},

  abstract = {Economic inequality has been hypothesized to be a determinant of population health, independent of poverty and household income. We examined the association between economic inequality and child malnutrition in Ecuador. Economic inequality was measured by the Gini coefficient of household per capita consumption, estimated from the 1990 Census. Childhood stunting, assessed from height-for-age z scores, was obtained from the 1998 Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS). We controlled for a range of individual and household covariates, including per capita food consumption, education, housing, ethnicity, fertility, access to health services, diarrhea morbidity, child care, mother's age and diet composition. Stunting still affects 26\% of children under five in Ecuador, with higher prevalence in the rural Highlands and among indigenous peoples. Maternal education, basic housing conditions, access to health services, ethnicity, fertility, maternal age and diet composition were independently associated with stunting. However, after controlling for relevant covariates, economic inequality at the provincial scale had a statistically significant deleterious effect on stunting. At municipal or local levels, inequality was not associated with stunting.},

  abstract = {As of 2019, more than 1.2 million Venezuelans passed through Ecuador and more than 400,000 settled (almost 3 percent of Ecuador’s population). This paper analyzes the location choices of Venezuelan migrants in Ecuador and the labour market consequences of these choices, using data from Ecuador’s labour force survey and mobile phone records on the geographic distribution of Venezuelan migrants. Around half of the migrants live in four cantons (of 221). Their location is primarily driven by local economic conditions, rather than point of entry. Overall, the regions with the largest inflows of Venezuelans have not seen any effects on labour market participation or employment, compared with regions with fewer inflows. However, our difference-in-difference estimates clearly indicate that young, low-educated Ecuadoran workers in high-inflow regions have been adversely affected. Specifically, the estimates show that these workers have experienced reductions in employment quality, a 5 percentage-point increase in the rate of informality, and a 13 percentage-point reduction in earnings, relative to workers with similar characteristics living in areas with very low or non-existent inflows of Venezuelans.},

  abstract = {This chapter summarizes the work in Rivadeneira (2023), where I use hand-collected and digitized historical tax records from Ecuador’s Spanish colonial regime to estimate the long-run effects of a forced labor institution named concertaje. This institution, which lasted for more than 300 years, allowed landlords to retain indigenous workers due to unpaid debts and forced them to work in rural estates known as haciendas. To identify its causal effects, I exploit variations in its intensity caused by differences in crops’ labor requirements. I first report that an increase of 10 percentage points in concertaje rate increments contemporary poverty by 4.2 percentage points. I then explore several channels of persistence that might explain those results. As hacienda workers used to inherit their status to children, the latter typically substituted school for work. Consequently, districts with higher concertaje rates have been historically associated with lower educational levels. In addition, the voting restrictions for illiterates cast them away from public affairs, reflected in a reduced provision of public goods like roads. I also report that due to restricted labor mobility, concertaje is associated with a higher fraction of people working nowadays in the agricultural sector.},
